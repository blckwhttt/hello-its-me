# 👋 Twine! (Frontend)

Welcome to the frontend repository of **Twine** — a next-generation messenger built primarily for gamers who value quality, speed, and freedom.

We are building a space where communication is crystal clear, completely free, and void of harsh restrictions. No paywalls for higher bitrate, no artificial limits — just you and your squad.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
We believe that "gamer aesthetic" doesn't have to mean aggressive red accents or cluttered interfaces. We follow a **Refined Gamer** approach:

- **Minimalism & Modernity**: A clean interface aimed at performance and comfort.
- **Violet Vibes**: We love the violet spectrum. It’s deep, calming, and stylish.
- **Smart UX**: We don't leave you guessing. Expect helpful tooltips and clear explanations for complex audio/video settings.
- **Roobert Typography**: Using the *Roobert* font for a friendly yet modern look that keeps things readable during long sessions.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle blur effects and smooth animations (scale/opacity) that make the app feel alive without killing your GPU.

## 🛠 Under the Hood
We use a cutting-edge stack to ensure low latency and high stability:

- **Angular 20** (Standalone) — Modern architecture without legacy baggage.
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — For rapid, consistent styling.
- **Electron** — Delivering a native desktop experience.
- **WebRTC** — The engine behind our high-quality audio and video.
- **Socket.IO** — Instant state synchronization.
- **Lucide Icons** — Crisp visual language.

## 🚀 Open Source & Context
This repository contains the **client-side code**. While our Backend is currently private (it's a bit shy), everything here is open for inspection.

We are building this for production, focusing on security, scalability, and — most importantly — a user experience that respects your time and hardware.

*Made with love, code, and zero cringe.*

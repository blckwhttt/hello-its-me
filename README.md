# 👋 Hello, it's me! (Frontend)

Hi there! You've reached the holy grail — the frontend of our video calling and screen sharing app. Yes, this is the part users stare at 99% of the time (hopefully with joy).

We're building a cozy place for communication where you can create a room, call your friends, and share your screen (even if it shows code that doesn't work yet).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
We love living on the bleeding edge (and sometimes cutting ourselves on it), so our stack is fresh:

- **Angular 18** (Standalone Components) — because modules are so last season.
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — styling at the speed of light without context switching.
- **Electron** — wrapping all this beauty into a native desktop app.
- **Socket.IO Client** — real-time magic, so your "Hello!" arrives instantly.

## 🚀 About
This is the Open Source client part of our project. Our backend is a bit shy (and keeps secrets), so it lives separately. But here everything is transparent! Explore, suggest improvements, or just watch how we cook up Angular.
